# Lesson 1 - Sorting Hat

## Introduction
In this lesson, students will create a Raspberry Pi powered Harry Potter style sorting hat. Students will also learn how to connect a physical button to the Pibrella and program it to control the sorting hat.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and use sequence in an algorithm
- Understand and use iteration in an algorithm (FOR and WHILE loops)
- Understand and use selection in an algorithm (IF, Else and Else if)
- Understand how to control Input & Output devices 

## Learning Outcomes:
**All students are able to:**

**Most students are able to:**

**Some students are able to:**

## Lesson Summary
- Introduction to setting up a Raspberry Pi
- Writing a python program using functions, loops and conditionals.

## Starter
Read pages pages 85 - 97 from [harry potter and the philosopher's stone] to the class (this could have been set as homework from the priovous lesson) or alternatively if you have access to the Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Film, play the sorting hat clip. You could also ask students to sort themselves into the four houses of ravenclaw, slytherin, hufflepuff and gryffindor just for fun and discuss their reasoning. 

## Main Development
1. Demonstrate the final sorting hat project to the class by selecting students, asking them to wear the hat and then asking another student to press the button. Discuss with students what do they think is needed to make the project. Draw out through questioning and list on the board all the component pieces. Ask students to tell you if they are hardware or software related.
1. Ask students to set up their Raspberry Pi equipment, turn it on and log into their Pi using the username `pi` and the password `raspberry`.

*Note that students will not see any text when typing the password but assure them it is working. Why do they think this might be the case? Hint: what might happen if someone was looking over their shoulder?*

1. Next, students should load the graphical environment by typing `startx`. Once the desktop has loaded, show students how to open **IDLE3** either by double-clicking on the desktop icon, or by clicking on the **Main Menu** followed by **Programming** and selecting **IDLE3**.

*Note that this series of lessons uses Python 3. If students run IDLE then their code may not run.*

Explain to students that **IDLE3** is an application or environment that allows you to write a simple program using the programming language Python. It allows you to write, edit and run code.


## Plenary

## Extension

- Connect multiple LEDs (One for each Hogwarts House / Group) and make each one flash depending on which house / group is picked
- Record your own audio (These could be houses in your school, colours or numbers)
- Add a second switch which will power up the Raspberry Pi and launch your python script on startup (Click here for help)

## Setting up your [Pibrella](http://pibrella.com/#setup)

You will need a Pibrella board attached to the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi for this lesson. Attach your Pibrella by pushing the connector over the top of the first 26 pins of your Raspberry Pi.

## Connect the push button / switch using two jumper wires

Plug the male end of a male-to-female jumper wire into the input socket labelled 'A' on your Pibrella. Push a paperclip into the other end of the jumper wire. Plug the other jumper wire into the slot next to the input socket on the same row labelled 'A'. Push another paperclip into the female end of the jumper wire. Use the paperclips to connect to the button.

*Important! Make sure you connect the leads to Input A (See below)*

## Boot your Raspberry Pi

Now add the rest of the peripherals to your Raspberry Pi, add the power to turn it on, and wait for it to boot. Log into your Raspberry Pi when prompted with the login: `pi` and the password `raspberry`.

# Raspberry Pi Sorting Hat

## Introduction

In this lesson, students will create a Raspberry Pi powered Harry Potter style sorting hat. Students will also learn how to connect a physical button to the Pibrella and program it to control the sorting hat.

## Learning Outcomes

## Computing Program of Study Met
KS2:
- Design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals; solve problems by breaking them into smaller parts. 
- Select, use and combine a variety of software on a range of digital devices to design and create a range of programs.
- Use sequence, selection and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output
- Use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work; detect and correct errors in algorithms and programs

KS3:
- Use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems. 

## Resources
For the majority of the lesson, it is suggested that work is carried out by students on a Raspberry Pi in pairs or a small group. Each pair or group should have access to the standard equipment described below:

- A Raspberry Pi
- The latest NOOBS SD card with Raspbian installed
- A keyboard and mouse connected to the Raspberry Pi per pair
- A monitor connected to the Raspberry Pi per pair
- A [Pibrella](http://pibrella.com)
- 1 x Push button / switch ** (example: Large Red Push Button) 
- Male-to-female jumper leads ** (example: Jumper Lead Cables for Arduino/Raspberry Pi)
- 1 x speakers
- Hat

See [teachers setup instructions](teachers-instructions.md) for more information.
